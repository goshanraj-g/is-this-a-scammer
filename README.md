![Scam Call Detection]()  

## 🚀 Overview  

Spam and scam calls are a growing problem, often leading to fraud and privacy breaches.  
**is-this-a-scammer** helps identify suspicious numbers in real-time by cross-referencing them with scam databases, user reports, and machine learning models.

## 🛡️ How It Works  

### 📌 Number Validation & Metadata Extraction  
- Validate phone numbers and retrieve:  
  - **Carrier (e.g., AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone)**  
  - **Country & Region**  
  - **Type (Mobile, Landline, VoIP, etc.)**  
- **APIs Used:** [Twilio Lookup API](https://www.twilio.com/lookup), [NumVerify API](https://numverify.com/)  

### 🔍 Cross-Checking with Scam Databases  
- Compare phone numbers against:  
  - **Government databases** (FCC, Ofcom)  
  - **Crowd-sourced scam databases** (Hiya, Truecaller)  
- **APIs Used:** [Hiya API](https://hiya.com/), [Truecaller API](https://www.truecaller.com/), [FCC/Ofcom Scam Reports](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/stop-unwanted-robocalls-and-texts)  

### 👥 Community-Driven Scam Reports  
- Users can **report scam numbers** and provide details (e.g., `"123-456-7890: IRS Scam"`).  
- A **voting/validation system** ensures the accuracy of reported scams.  
- Reports are stored in a **PostgreSQL database** to flag suspicious numbers.  

### 📊 Frequency-Based Scam Detection  
- Numbers frequently reported as scams are flagged as **high-risk**.  
- Frequently searched numbers are **cached** in **Redis** for faster lookups.  

### 🤖 AI-Based Scam Detection (Future Feature)  
- Machine learning models will analyze:  
  - **Call patterns**  
  - **Scam keywords**  
  - **Caller behavior**  
- This will help detect potential scams before reports surface.

## 🎯 Building a Scam Honeypot  

To actively detect **new** scam numbers, we create a **honeypot system**—a network of **dummy phone numbers** designed to attract scammers.  

### 🛠 How It Works  
1. **Deploy virtual phone numbers** using Twilio or a VoIP provider.  
2. **Seed these numbers online** (fake social media accounts, forums, spam-baiting sites).  
3. **Monitor incoming calls**:
   - Extract metadata (**caller ID, location, carrier, VoIP status**).  
   - Record and transcribe scam calls for **speech analysis**.  
   - Log call frequency and patterns to detect **new scam techniques**.  

### 🔎 Key Insights Gained  
- Common **scam scripts and tactics**.  
- Caller ID **spoofing techniques** used by scammers.  
- **Geographic trends** in scam operations.  

### 🛠 Tech Stack for the Scam Honeypot  
- **[Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/)** / **[Plivo](https://www.plivo.com/)** / **[Nexmo](https://www.nexmo.com/)** → Generate & manage virtual numbers.  
- **[Asterisk](https://www.asterisk.org/)** / **[FreePBX](https://www.freepbx.org/)** → Log incoming scam calls.  
- **[Google Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/)** → Convert scam call recordings into text for analysis.  
- **[Python (Flask / FastAPI)](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)** → Process and analyze honeypot data.
